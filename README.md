I happily joined the Laboratory of Pathology at NCI/NIH as a postdoctoral fellow since June 2024. I'm currently working on designing deep learning pipeline to classify H\&E images into tumors subtypes. This research aims to extand the accessability of advanced cancer diagnosis techniques to more people. We build and evaulate tools using vision foundation models and cutting-edge AI techniques that designed specificaly for H\&E images to facilitate clinical usage.

Before NCI, I got my Ph.D. in Comuputer Science at New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology ([NMT](www.nmt.edu)) in Jan 2024. My PhD research interests were on deep learning, time series classification, and neural architecture search. To learn more about me, you can find my most recent CV [[here]](https://zhiruiluo.github.io/my_cv/main_cv.pdf). My Ph.D. dissertation on Smart Meter Data Analytics using Deep Learning methods. I applied Neural Architecture Search (NAS) approach to build an automated pipeline searching for a better model on time series classification. My research also covers other smart meter data analytics applications such as building occupancy detection, socio-demographic information identification, and nonintrusive load monitoring.
